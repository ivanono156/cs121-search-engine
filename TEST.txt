The queries marked with * performed worse with our original retrieval implementation. To improve the run time, we
switched our retrieval function from boolean model to the cosine similarity method. Longer queries took more time
because we had many nested for loops, so we moved away from nested for loops unless necessary (e.g. using nested
for loops to look at each posting for each term.)
